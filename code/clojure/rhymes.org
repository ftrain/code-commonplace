** What Is this document?
So let's say we want to create a rhyming dictionary in Clojure. Not
so much a rhyming dictionary application---although you /could/
create such a thing---but a data structure that contains
pronunciation data and which we could use in any program.

[[http://rhetoricaldevice.com][Jack Rusher]], a good friend and computer scientist, put up this code
here...
 
https://gist.github.com/jackrusher/8640437

...to demonstrate some interesting aspects of Clojure. Then he
encouraged his friends to figure it out. I'm going to study this
code and learn as I go. 

The structure of this document (and thus a template for future
documents of this sort) is:

- Introduction
- The plain old code
- What data are we dealing with?
- What are we going to do to deal with that data?
- Let's apply what we've learned!
- Notes and findings

** What Is the Code? 
This code works with a file downloaded from...

http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict.0.7a

...and renamed to cmudict.txt.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (def rhyme-txt
    (map #(string/split % #"[ ]+") 
       (string/split-lines (slurp "cmudict.txt"))))

    (reduce (fn [m [word & rhyme]]
              (assoc m
                (string/lower-case word)
                (mapv #(keyword 
                         (string/replace %1 #"[0-9]" "")) (reverse rhyme))))
            {} rhyme-txt))

#+END_SRC

** What Is the Data?
First I put it in a namespace.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(ns unscroll.rhyme
  (:require 
    [clojure.string :as string]))
#+END_SRC

So that I can mess with it inside my current environment in
emacs.

Here is the first function.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def rhyme-txt
  (map #(string/split % #"[ ]+")
    (string/split-lines
      (slurp "data/cmudict.txt"))))
#+END_SRC

So this presumes a file called cmudict.txt, the CMU pronunciation
dictionary. Which is sort of an old standby for word nerds, like
WordNet too, from back in the day before everything was free and
a pronunciation dictionary in digital form felt like an almost
unbearably large gift from the Gods.

The format of the dictionary is such:

#+BEGIN_SRC
   ABDOMEN  AE0 B D OW1 M AH0 N
#+END_SRC

i.e. something like

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    WORD[SPACE]PHONEME_1[SPACE]PHONEME_2[SPACE]...PHONEME_N[NEWLINE]
#+END_QUOTE


So we (slurp) in the file, split the lines by newlines, and then
split on space.

Gotta love (slurp); one thing it took me a while to figure out
the other day is that slurp starts looking for files at the top
level of the Clojure project. Where the source files are means
nothing to Clojure (because they means nothing to the JVM); it's
the project that sets the path. Just putting this here to save
someone else the 20 minutes.

Anyway now that we've done that we can say:
(take 3 (drop 1010 rhyme-txt))

(Okay so we're not getting rid of comments in the dictionary
source or anything when we do this, it's fast-and-dirty. So for
purposes of the example we want to fast-forward past a bunch of
comments and miscellany to get a clear example, so start around
item 1010)

And we'd see

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (["ACTUARY" "AE1" "K" "CH" "UW0" "EH1" "R" "IY2"]
      ["ACTUATE" "AE1" "K" "CH" "UW2" "EY1" "T"]
      ["ACTUATOR" "AE1" "K" "T" "Y" "UW0" "EY2" "T" "ER0"])
#+END_SRC

   
So now we're dealing with a list () of vectors [] where the first
value is a string representing word and the rest are strings
representing phonemes.

** What Functions Operate on the Data?
There's a lot going on with this one as there always is with
Clojure code. Let's see how it gets called first:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (get-deepest-values (get-in rhyme-to-word (take 3
    (word-to-rhyme "connection"))))
#+END_SRC


Which could probably be a function of its own called (rhyme).
Although I've noticed Jack doesn't really care much whether
something is a function or a variable, it's like it DOESN'T EVEN
MATTER. Hmm.

Anyway, we're going to give this function, (word-to-rhyme) a word
and get something back.


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (word-to-rhyme "connection")
#+END_SRC


and we get

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    [:N :AH :SH :K :EH :N :AH :K]
#+END_SRC


which is the reverse order of phonemes. Which makes sense, we're
building a rhyming dictionary, gonna go end to beginning in terms
of phonemes.

Going to add a crazy amount of indenting here so I can see the
levels more clearly as a n00b.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def word-to-rhyme
  (reduce (fn [m [word & rhyme]]
            (assoc m
              (string/lower-case word)
              (mapv
                #(keyword
                   (string/replace %1 #"[0-9]" ""))
                (reverse rhyme))))
    {} rhyme-txt))
#+END_SRC


This is a funny one because as I mess with the parens my java
keeps running out of heap space. So it's clearly doing a lot,
like loading the whole CMU dictionary into memory. This is
something that seems to happen when you mix in-buffer evaluation
with lazy evaluation--occasionally you'll just blow up your
session because you put something in the wrong place and called
it a billion times instead of 100.

The super hot LISPY action in there is


#+BEGIN_BLOCKQUOTE
    (reduce function = [that function] 
                 val = [an empty map {}]
                coll = [rhyme-txt, our list of vectors])
#+END_BLOCKQUOTE

Clojure docs are kind of a bear. For reduce, they say "If val is
supplied, returns the result of applying f to val and the first
item in coll, then applying f to that result and the 2nd item,
etc." Awesome. Although I will say that they are always accurate
and if you read them ten or twenty times they start to make
sense. (Plus the community is completely tutorial-mad, there's no
shortage of ways to learn this language, although in my case
having an old-school Comp Sci guy as a friend helps.)

So what reduce does here is return the results applying that
function in there to {} and the first item in the rhyme-text,
then applies that to the second item, etc.

In

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     [m [word & rhyme]]
#+END_SRC


it's going to be applied with values like:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    [{} ["CONNECTION" K AH N EH K SH AH N ]]
#+END_SRC


That's interesting because we have the [word & rhyme]--the way
that destructuring works, rhyme will catch all of the phonemes
into a list; it's almost like the CMU people could predict this
kind of programming would occur using their dictionary. Or that
Clojure was designed to deal with data structures like those in
the CMU dictionary. Or that programmers should be creating data
structures like those in the CMU dictionary that are easy to
comprehend and manipulate as lists. Who knows?

Then we say:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (assoc map key val)
#+END_SRC


Or here:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (assoc {} "connection" ...)
#+END_SRC


And then a couple things happen on the way to passing THAT
parameter.

FIRST we reverse the rhyme (reverse rhyme) so

#+BEGIN_SRC
    K AH0 N EH1 K SH AH0 N
#+END_SRC


becomes

#+BEGIN_SRC
   AH0 SH K EH1 N AH0 K
#+END_SRC


SECOND we replace all the numbers with nothing (likely because we
just don't need the data, can't remember why CMU uses numbers)

we do that with a regular expression yielding

#+BEGIN_SRC
    N AH SH K EH N AH K
#+END_SRC


THIRD we run a mapv across that list of phonemes--that is, apply
to each element and return a vector. And what we are applying is
the "keyword" function which turns a string to a clojure keyword so
we end up with a structure like:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    {"connection" [:N :AH :SH :K :EH :N :AH :K]}
#+END_SRC


NOTE: I'm not sure WHY we're converting to keywords but they are
prettier in general and make for better keywords in maps, and I'm
assuming they actually are optimized as, like, keywords, so....

Anyway, and then we repeat that (lazily, I guess, so in chunks of
32 or whatever it is that Clojure does?) as needed until we've
slurped up the whole file into a big map or what I still think of
as an associative array.  Aaaand now we have a variable that
defines a function that when given--

Oh god, I SEE. I ACTUALLY SEE. This is a def instead of a
function for a reason. It's a var that calls a function which
returns a map, but in Clojure a map can operate as a function. So
when I say:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (word-to-rhyme "connection")
#+END_SRC


I'm causing the interpreter to read the entirety of the
dictionary into a map, and assigning that map to "word-to-rhyme"
and then because I'm calling word-to-rhyme as the first item in a
sexp, the interpreter evaluates it as a function and returns the
phonemes that it has assoc'd to that word.

Clojure is kind of dense.

So I'm going to assume we're in similar territory here with this
variable def.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def rhyme-to-word
  (reduce
    (fn [m [word rhyme]]
      (assoc-in m rhyme { :terminate word }))
    {}
    word-to-rhyme))
#+END_SRC


Aand we are, KIND OF. Hmm. So in this case we take the map (now
just a map) from word-to-rhyme and do another reduce, except the
structure we're building up is going to be a trie (?) so we're
going:


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (assoc-in {} [:N :AH :SH :K :EH :N :AH :K] { :terminate
     "connection" })
#+END_SRC


And as a result we're getting:


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    {:N {:AH {:SH {:K {:EH {:N {:AH {:K {:terminate
    "connection"}}}}}}}}}
#+END_SRC


Great but that's one word. NOW Clojure hands that same map back
to the reduce with ANOTHER word, and so on for thousands of
words, building up a huge nested behemoth of a data structure.

So we've passed assoc-in the phonemes for "connection"; we can
now pass it "correction" and they should be all jammed up in a
really nice way...


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (assoc-in (assoc-in {} [:N :AH :SH :K :EH :N :AH :K] {
      :terminate "connection" }) [:N :AH :SH :K :EH :ER :K]
      {:terminate "correction"})
#+END_SRC

Okay, yes we end up with something that will let us take one
word, look up the phonemes (in reverse order) and look for
similar phonemes, then map those back to the words. That's what
we have here, no doubt. Looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    {:N {:AH {:SH {:K {:EH {:ER {:K {:terminate "correction"}}, :N
    {:AH {:K {:terminate "connection"}}}}}}}}}
#+END_SRC


And since I can assoc-in I can get-in too and pull stuff out.

Okay so on we go...

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn get-deepest-values [k]
  (if (string? k) [k] (mapcat get-deepest-values (vals k))))
#+END_SRC


What the hell is this? What is it for? OH GOD.

So here we're looking for strings inside a nest of keywords--that
makes sense. What is mapcat? Clojure docs:

#+BEGIN_BLOCKQUOTE
    "Returns the result of applying concat to the result of
    applying map to f and colls. Thus function f should return a
    collection."
#+END_BLOCKQUOTE

Great, thanks Clojure docs. You're my bosom robot pal.

What it means I think is that you're going to give this function
a bundle of stuff and it'll do something to each piece of stuff
(MAP!...) and then smush everything together into one nice list
(...!CAT).  So we're saying given a nested associated structure
like the one we just made, pull out all the values ...

Wait hold on--let's look at how it's actually called.

Okay this is the big mooooment

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(get-deepest-values
  (get-in rhyme-to-word
    (take 5
      (word-to-rhyme "erection"))))
#+END_SRC


(Erection, eh Jack?)

And this gives a result thus:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    ("erection" "direction" "correction" "collection" "inflection"
    "preelection" "circumspection" "introspection" "imperfection"
    "perfection" "midsection" "transection" "connection"
    "protection")
#+END_SRC


But sometimes it's all too last-first for me, so let's do that
using this guy "->>"--which is a macro that allows you to put
things in normal human-person order instead of LISPbot order,
passing the results of the first function call as the last
parameter to the next function and on and on.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(->>
  
  (word-to-rhyme "erection")
  ;; gives us [:N :AH :SH :K :EH :R :IH]

  (take 5)
  ;; gives us (:N :AH :SH :K :EH)--i.e. five phonemes, or the "ection" part of the rhyme.

  (get-in rhyme-to-word)
  ;; so we're calling (get-in rhyme-to-word '(:N :AH :SH :K :EH))
  ;; and we get this result:
  ;;
  ;;    {:R {:IH {:terminate "erection"}}, :ER {:D {:terminate
  ;;    "direction"}, :K {:terminate "correction"}}, :L {:AH {:K
  ;;    {:terminate "collection"}}, :F {:N {:IH {:terminate
  ;;    "inflection"}}}, :IH {:IY {:R {:P {:terminate
  ;;    "preelection"}}}}}, :P {:S {:M {:AH {:K {:ER {:S {:terminate
  ;;    "circumspection"}}}}}, :AH {:R {:T {:N {:IH {:terminate
  ;;    "introspection"}}}}}}}, :F {:ER {:P {:M {:IH {:terminate
  ;;    "imperfection"}}, :terminate "perfection"}}}, :S {:D {:IH
  ;;    {:M {:terminate "midsection"}}}, :N {:AE {:R {:T {:terminate
  ;;    "transection"}}}}}, :N {:AH {:K {:terminate "connection"}}},
  ;;    :T {:AH {:R {:P {:terminate "protection"}}}}}
  ;;
  ;; Okay so THAT's what we're passing in when we call....
  
  (get-deepest-values))
#+END_SRC


So it turns out that all that


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (defn get-deepest-values [k]
     (if (string? k) [k] (mapcat get-deepest-values (vals k))))
#+END_SRC


does is say: Hey pal, get the values from the key/value pairs
that are in a map called "k." If you hit any value at all that is
a string, return it and you're done for that part. OTHERWISE keep
mapping over the values and run this function again on each one
of them (until you hit a string). And however nested things are
is fine and all, but please return a nice flat list of results
(that's why it's mapcat instead of cat").

So it's like you gave it a Russian nested doll, except this is
LISP so it's a Siamese Russian nested doll where the number of
conjoined twins varies from nil to infinity. And it keeps looking
inside the first twin's dolls until it finds a piece of paper
with a word or two on it. Then it throws away all the dolls
around those words. And it does the same to the other twin. Maybe
the first twin is three dolls deep. Maybe the second twin is four
dolls deep. Doesn't even matter. Get-deepest-values just digs
right in there.

Of all of them, these tiny recursive functions are the hardest to
write and understand.

Anyway, that's how it works, I think.

** Application: Byronic Bigrams

Okay so we have a nice rhyming dictionary. But Jack insists on
complicating things and drops in this fun-fest.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def byron-bigrams [["soul" "wears"] ["light" "of"] ["moon" "be"]
                     ["outwears" "its"] ["the" "soul"]
                     ["night" "though"] ["heart" "must"]
                     ["out" "the"] ["be" "still"] ["love" "itself"]
                     ["the" "light"] ["pause" "to"] ["yet" "we"]
                     ["for" "loving"] ["day" "returns"]
                     ["the" "night"] ["too" "soon"] ["for" "the"]
                     ["a" "roving"] ["will" "go"] ["loving" "and"]
                     ["sword" "outwears"] ["to" "breathe"]
                     ["breast" "and"] ["still" "as"] ["so" "late"]
                     ["the" "day"] ["was" "made"] ["the" "sword"]
                     ["more" "a"] ["soon" "yet"] ["must" "pause"]
                     ["roving" "by"] ["the" "moon"]
                     ["returns" "too"] ["itself" "have"]
                     ["night" "was"] ["into" "the"] ["we" "will"]
                     ["breathe" "and"] ["sheath" "and"] ["so" "we"]
                     ["roving" "so"] ["no" "more"] ["made" "for"]
                     ["the" "heart"] ["though" "the"] ["go" "no"]
                     ["late" "into"] ["wears" "out"] ["and" "the"]
                     ["of" "the"] ["by" "the"] ["and" "love"]
                     ["the" "breast"] ["heart" "be"] ["as" "loving"]
                     ["its" "sheath"]])
#+END_SRC



#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(group-by (comp (partial take 2) word-to-rhyme last) byron-bigrams)
#+END_SRC


It's a PUZZLER. I just want to be done now, friends. I just want
to not be recursing. But let's chill and take it bit by bit. The
dude has 30 years of reasons for writing code this way.

First, the data above is a set of bigrams (subsequent word pairs)
from Lord Byron's "We'll go no more a-roving."

http://www.bartleby.com/101/599.html

I was able to figure that out by the fact that the variable is
named "byron" plus "bigrams" and included the word "roving." This
part at least makes sense, thanks to Google.

So let's put that into a var.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def roving-poem "SO, we'll go no more a-roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul wears out the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon, 
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
By the light of the moon.")
#+END_SRC


Now Jack already has his bigrams in here. But I want to make my
own damned bigrams. I tried a few different ways of making
bigrams, here's one approach, with ten failures left out but a
few failures left in.

Let's break up roving-poem into lowercase words using a regular
expression and the lower-case function.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def some-words 
  (map string/lower-case
    (string/split roving-poem #"[\s\.\-,]+")))
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(take 10 some-words)
=> ("so" "we'll" "go" "no" "more" "a" "roving" "so" "late" "into")
#+END_SRC


I'm really excited to have a function called "bigrammer" so let's
go all the way and call it big-rammer. I started like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn big-rammer0 [words]
  (if (< (count words) 2)
    (vec (first words) (second words)
      (big-rammer0 rest words))))
#+END_SRC

But when I went

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(big-rammer0 some-words)
#+END_SRC


It returns nil, which suuuucks. Nil is the opposite of what I
want (not really, nil is not the opposite of things, nil is a
mysterious nothing.) Then I realized that the (if ...)  is
probably in the wrong place, which always happens and got to:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn big-rammer1 [words]
  (list (first words) (second words)
    (if (> (count words) 2)
      (big-rammer1 (rest words)))))

(big-rammer1 some-words)
#+END_SRC


And that returned


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    ("so" "we'll" ("we'll" "go" ("go" "no" ...[snipped a bunch]
    nil)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
    )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
#+END_SRC


Which is just way too many parentheses, even for Clojure.

Now I know there is stuff like (flatten) and (filter identity)
that would get me a flat list without the nil on the end. Nils
are kind of the bane of my existence in Clojure, they keep
showing up and I never know what to do with them. But that's not
what I want; I want to get every two items and put them together
just so without a whole lot of shenanigans to flatten the
list. This has to be possible.

Let's just try the recursive model a little bit more.

Okay, I got it, maybe.

Here's how I'd describe the following function in english: Given
a buncha words ("cat" "dog" "ferret" "weasel"), do two things:
make a list with all but the first of those words ("dog" "ferret"
"weasel") and also a tiny list with the first and second word
("cat "dog"). Then go ahead and call the EXACT SAME function on
the first list with all but the first of the words---and KEEP
calling that bad boy until it's down to two items. Then call it
quits (which will return nil because there's nothing to
return). Every time you made that call you make those tiny lists
with two items, right? Well once you've exhausted the longer list
you take all of them and conj[oin] them into one list of lists.

Actually this part of LISP drives me crazy, I never quite GET IT,
so let's break it down in exhaustive detail.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn big-rammer2 [words]
  (if (> (count words) 1)
    (vec (conj (big-rammer2 (rest words))
           (vec (list (first words) (second words)))))))

(big-rammer2 '("cat" "dog" "ferret" "weasel"))  
#+END_SRC


This produces

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[["ferret" "weasel"] ["dog" "ferret"] ["cat" "dog"]]
#+END_SRC


Which is what we want. And man does it look LISPy, especially the
part where it goes ")))))))"

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (big-rammer2 some-words)
#+END_SRC


gives us a nice vector too, because
we wrapped our lists in (vec). So now things are starting to look
like byron-bigrams up top. We're getting somewhere.

Okay let's run it piece by piece, interpolating the growing list
of vectors.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(big-rammer2 '("cat" "dog" "ferret" "weasel"))
#+END_SRC


PASS 1

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(vec (conj
  (big-rammer2
    '("dog" "ferret" "weasel"))
       ["cat" "dog"]))
#+END_SRC

Result: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[["cat" "dog"] ["dog" "ferret"] ["ferret" "weasel"]]
#+END_SRC


PASS 2
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(vec (conj
  (big-rammer2
    '("ferret" "weasel"))
       ["dog" "ferret"] ["cat" "dog"]))
#+END_SRC


Result: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[["cat" "dog"] ["dog" "ferret"] ["ferret" "weasel"]]
#+END_SRC


PASS 3
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(vec (conj
  (big-rammer2
    '("weasel"))
       ["ferret" "weasel"] ["dog" "ferret"] ["cat" "dog"]))
#+END_SRC

Result:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
 [["cat" "dog"] ["dog" "ferret"] ["ferret" "weasel"]]
#+END_SRC


PASS 4
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(vec (conj nil ["ferret" "weasel"] ["dog" "ferret"] ["cat" "dog"]))
#+END_SRC

Result: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[["cat" "dog"] ["dog" "ferret"] ["ferret" "weasel"]]
#+END_SRC


The interesting thing is that if you DON'T have that nil it goes
pear-shaped. So if I run:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(vec (conj ["ferret" "weasel"] ["dog" "ferret"] ["cat" "dog"]))
#+END_SRC


I get:


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   ["ferret" "weasel" ["dog" "ferret"] ["cat" "dog"]]
#+END_SRC


Tooo nested. Now, what the hell, let's go a little deeper on
conj. Because conjoining does all manner of stuff. Let's refer to
the [[http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/conj][docs]]:

#+BEGIN_BLOCKQUOTE
   conj[oin]. Returns a new collection with the xs 'added'. (conj
   nil item) returns (item). The 'addition' may happen at different
   'places' depending on the concrete type.
#+END_BLOCKQUOTE

ARGH. It's like biting into a brick. So what are we really doing?

Let's break this down:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(conj [:foo] [:bar])
#+END_SRC


Makes

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   [:foo [:bar]]
#+END_SRC


Whereas

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(conj nil [:foo] [:bar])
#+END_SRC


Makes
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   ([:bar] [:foo])
#+END_SRC


Because it is CONJOINING bar /into/ foo. Whereas the docs, with
their inimitable clarity, say:

#+BEGIN_BLOCKQUOTE
    "(conj nil item) returns (item)"
#+END_BLOCKQUOTE

So in theory...

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(= (list ["a"] ["b"]) (conj nil ["b"] ["a"]))
#+END_SRC


And indeed that /is/ true. Because conjing ["b"] onto nil produces
(["b"]), and then conjing ["a"] onto that puts it into the list that
contains ["b"].

So this is a /big discovery/ for me. You process items and throw
them at the end of a recursive function and then conjoin them when
it's all done. Now the nil value produced when the function is
called for the last time becomes the FIRST item that conjoin
sees--and so conjoin goes ahead and puts everything that follows
into a list. But it's /as if expressing everything in sequences were
some sort of insane sickly goal./ Which sure, I get that, I'm
programming in a LISP, but it is weird when you see it up
close. Like when you see your screen is made of pixels.

I.e. the thing I'm trying to get to/comprehend is that in Clojure
it's not just that there are a lot of lists (seqs); it's that
lists inform every aspect of the language and if you don't see a
list, or some relationship that can be expressed as a set of
lists, you should keep looking. If you don't see/feel a sequence,
you're not looking hard enough. And this kind of makes sense
because computers at their essence just put stuff in boxes and
take stuff out of boxes in predetermined sequences. So this is a
funny thing about LISP because it's a suuuuuper-crazy abstraction
and maps to lambda calculus, but it's simultaneously weirdly
close to the metal, which is why it must appeal to a certain kind
of nerd. I find this really comforting but I can see why other
people would not. I think this is what Jack is trying to tell me!
(It is; I actually checked with him to be sure.)

Anyway all of this is moot because I also went and searched for a
bigram-maker and found one in incanter, which is a general
purpose math/stats library for Clojure.

And what that makes clear is that we can use the partition
function--here called as (partition 2 1) which goes ahead and takes
a list of two things, fast-forwards by one thing, takes the next two
things, fast forwards by one thing, etc. So partition is a built-in
that does what our recursive function does above but I /regret
nothing/. So we can get all of our words at once by going:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def words 
  (map #(vec %) (partition 2 1
                  (map string/lower-case
                    (string/split roving-poem #"[\s\.\-,]+")))))
#+END_SRC

(Note: Jack points out that "#(vec %)" could just be "vec", but
everyone makes this mistake so I'm leaving it in.)

I.e. partition into bigrams and and then map those into vectors
(#() is shorthand for defining a function with an argument "%")
and you'll end up with a structure basically like the one Jack
has in his original (there are a few tiny differences; his
doesn't preserve apostrophes, but we're close enough now.) So I
feel okay about that. I get how to make bigrams both via map and
via a recursive funtion. Now let's get to the end....

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(group-by (comp (partial take 2) word-to-rhyme last) byron-bigrams)
#+END_SRC


Okay we're almost home.

"(comp...)" means we're going to make a function out of other
functions.

"(partial...)" means we're making a function with partial
arguments that can be called and evaluated with just the
"missing" arguments provided.

So...

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (= ((partial take 2) '(1 2 3 4))
     '(1 2))
    => true
#+END_SRC


That works fine but is of course most handy when you go:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (= 
     (map (partial take 2) [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]])
      '((1 2) (4 5) (7 8)))
    => true
#+END_SRC


This jibes with everything I've learned about LISP, which is that
LISP is about lots of tiny functions that can all live together
in beautiful harmony, except on Usenet.

Anyway if we execute the above with just the (first) of the
byron-bigrams...

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    ((comp (partial take 2) word-to-rhyme last) (first
    byron-bigrams))
    => (:Z :R)
#+END_SRC


That is the same as:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (take 2 (word-to-rhyme (last (first byron-bigrams))))
    => (:Z :R)
#+END_SRC


And so

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (= ((comp (partial take 2) word-to-rhyme last)
    (first byron-bigrams))
     (take 2 (word-to-rhyme (last (first byron-bigrams)))))
#+END_SRC


There's a lot of chitchat about functional composition out there in
LISPLand but all we're REALLY saying is "smush together all of
these functions so that they can be run over and over with data
of the sort that you'll find in byron-bigrams." Like, the
composition part should be easy--and here it is--the hard part is
in making composable functions.

Anyway, group-by is pretty familiar; just about every language
has it. It runs a function over a list and the result is the key
in a map, and the value that produced that key is added to a
vector on the right hand side. (PASS THE VECTOR TO THE RIGHT HAND
SIDE PASS THE VECTOR TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE). Anyway. So when we
run this we're going to get a map of all the bigrams where the
last two phonemes of the last word are exactly identical. Thus
we'll get all the bigrams that rhyme, at least in terms of two
phonemes meaning a "rhyme."

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(group-by (comp (partial take 2) word-to-rhyme last) byron-bigrams)
#+END_SRC


And we do! Here's what comes out:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{(:L :IH) [["be" "still"] ["we" "will"]], () [["sword" "outwears"]],
(:N :UW) [["too" "soon"] ["the" "moon"]], 
(:NG :IH) [["for" "loving"] ["a" "roving"] ["as" "loving"]],
(:OW :S) [["roving" "so"]], 
(:OW :DH) [["night" "though"]],

(:T :S) [["heart" "must"] ["the" "breast"]],

#+END_SRC


So there we are. Jack points out something important via chat
discussion on Google Jabberchat, which I'm adding here.

*** Jack annotates

#+BEGIN_BLOCKQUOTE
The lesson of the group-by is that if you parameterize your grouping
function with another function, you only need to write group-by
once---rather than having a group-by for each of your data types.

The sub-lessons are that composition and partial evaluation let you
improvise the function you use to do that parameterization, with
basically no ceremony.

Last thing on parameterizing functions with functions:
that’s also how the calculus works

__END JACK TRANSMISSION__
#+END_BLOCKQUOTE

"...that's also how the calculus works..." I mean come on. That's
fun. No one says that about web frameworks. They're all like "it
compiles SASS now!"

So basically we're done (but don't worry I've added a giant essay
to this because what is wrong with me.) Here are some possible
next steps:

1) Care about syllables
2) Look for words that are phonetic opposites of one another.
3) Wrap a web service around it.
4) Relax.

Here are some notes and observations from this exercise.


** What I Learned
*** Perlis!

The Alan Perlis maxim about having 100 functions operate on one
data structure keeps coming back to my head over and over. It's
like that quote is the data structure and my brain keeps
operating on it in 100 different ways.

*** Keep Like with Like

If things need to get processed, just do it inside the
function. Don't make tons of little functions like, say,
"filter-to-lowercase" or the like, as I would in Python hanging
off the class; just do it right there in the function. At some
level this fits well with my overall life/programming/editorial/
writing strategy of "keep like with like," which is the one true
principle of just about everything, but it requires a lot of
familiarity and comfort with the programming model--especially
the right-to-left depth-first model of LISPs--to really be
proficient in this kind of coding, to know where to break things
off into multiple functions.

*** It Really Is All Lists

Things WANT to be lists, and Clojure wants them to be
lists. Destructuring is not about dealing with arbitrary numbers
of arguments. It's about pulling out a few named arguments, then
throwing the rest into a sequence, so that you can quickly take
something dumb--a list of strings representing words and
phonemes--and make that list a little smarter. And repeat. Add
smarts, process the rest, add smarts, process the rest. The ethos
seems to be: Take dumb stuff, add smarts, repeat.

*** Data types
Getting things into the right data type really helps to simplify
your life. If you take the phonemes and make them keywords, going
from "EK" to :EK, then you can pull results out of a nested trie
structure and recursively look through it for the strings, which
are your payload, and ignore the keywords. My regular pattern is
to create really big associative arrays from any data source--to
reinvent XML or JSON in-memory, basically, with lots of nested
arrays and so forth; the idea here seems to be that the best
possible data structure is a nice plain list without a lot of
fooling around and it's okay to assume the code knows about the
data once they meet up; the data doesn't have to tell the code
what every field means. Again--my roots are document processing,
where that's actually a good thing. We take more for granted on
planet Clojure.


** Conclusion
You know, there's a strong, strong urge to never actually finish
anything when I'm in Clojure. This is because the "finished"
state is less relevant when you're evaluating code live inside a
text editor and looking at (and then parsing) the results back
into the same live coding environment. The whole idea of
"finished" seems kind of hilarious, like you are some sort of God
looking down on humans who are still maintaining state in
variables and sort of squinting and sighing, and since nothing is
ever REALLY done, why pretend otherwise?

I'm not using a REPL. I'm just evaluating, evaluating, evaluating
all day long. It's very easy to get separatist about this
environment. Meanwhile everyone else has shipped their websites
and gone out for dinner to celebrate their acquihiresition while
I'm sitting home at 2AM trying to understand the spiritual
essence of "conj."

EXCEPT I know in my little heart that I'm a better programmer
after two or three weeks of dabbling in Clojure. But I don't have
a TON to show, and not as much as I'd have with Python, for
certain. And I do have a product to ship. That said, huge amount
of opaque code (especially Emacs LISP) is far more open to me
than it used to be, and readable. And I've had an awful lot of
"oh wow actually that's very easy if you just use (partition)"
moments reading the standard library code. Lots of bits of
programmer culture--Jamie Zawinski rants, "Worse is Better,"
Haskell passion--make more sense.

So this is probably a net win. What Clojure is teaching me is to
calm down, look at the function signature in my Emacs modeline,
check the standard docs (control-C d), and then write a function
and rewrite it until it doesn't explode and does what I want. And
you just sort of keep on doing it. And if it comes together
(maybe the partial Wikipedia parser I'm writing could be useful)
you bundle it up and release it to Github.

Stuff like that recursive big-rammer2 function used to be really
hard for me to wrap my head around, and it's not any more--the
magic has gone out of it. It's nice to see magic destroyed. One
thing about magic is that when it gets bundled up 
but is still hidden from view (i.e. in frameworks) it leads to 
sameness of product. Every wizard has the same spells.

When you look at what people are doing so far, there doesn't seem
to be a prototypical Clojure app out in the world. People seem to
be focused on the language, and on gluing together things from other 
languages so they can be used here. It'll be
interesting to see what emerges. There are some web frameworks, but 
some minimal web app layers like Ring that make more sense to me right
now. Frameworks are great but they sure do lead to a
lot of apps that look and feel and...taste? alike. I'm not saying
things should be hard--I'm just saying that we create things with
our tools, and thus our tools have consequences.
